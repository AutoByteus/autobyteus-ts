# Agent Skills Design (Autobyteus)

This document describes the design and implementation of **Agent Skills** in the Autobyteus TypeScript framework.

## Philosophy: Human-Like Information Retrieval

The design of Agent Skills is fundamentally inspired by **how humans acquire and process information**.

When a human needs to learn a new subject (e.g., "Advanced Java Programming"), they do not memorize an entire library of books instantly. Instead, they follow a hierarchical process:

1.  **Awareness**: They know a library exists and what books are in it.
2.  **Selection**: They pick a specific book (`java_expert`) relevant to their current task.
3.  **Orientation**: They read the Table of Contents (`SKILL.md`) to understand the structure and where to find specific details.
4.  **Deep Dive**: They flip to specific chapters or reference distinct files (assets/code) _only when that specific detail is needed_.

This "Just-In-Time" learning model allows agents to have infinite potential knowledge without the cognitive load (context window) of holding it all at once.

The core philosophy of this design is **Context Economy**:

1.  **Lightweight Awareness**: The Agent is aware of _all_ available skills via minimal metadata (Name + Description) in the System Prompt.
2.  **Heavyweight Loading (On-Demand)**: The massive body of a skill (instructions, examples, data) is _only_ loaded into the context when explicitly triggered (dynamically).

## 1. Skill Definition: The Hierarchical "Skill as a Directory"

A **Skill** is not just a file; it is a **directory** acting as a self-contained knowledge base or toolkit.

- **The Entry Point (`SKILL.md`)**: This file serves as the "README" or "Map" for the skill. It contains high-level instructions and _pointers_ to other resources within the skill folder.
- **The Assets**: The folder can contain arbitrary files—code snippets in any language, detailed documentation, templates, or reference data.

### Structure Example

```text
skills/
  └── java_expert/
      ├── SKILL.md                 # The Entry Point
      ├── scripts/
      │   └── code_formatter.jar   # Executable asset
      ├── templates/
      │   └── SpringBootApp.java   # Code template
      └── docs/
          └── memory_model.md      # Deep-dive documentation
```

### `SKILL.md` Format

The file uses YAML Frontmatter for metadata. The body serves as the guide.

```markdown
---
name: java_expert
description: Java development expert with access to formatters and templates.
---

# Java Expert

You are a Java Expert.

1. **Formatting**: If you need to format code, run the jar found at `./scripts/code_formatter.jar`.
2. **Boilerplate**: For new apps, read the template at `./templates/SpringBootApp.java`.
```

**Path Resolution (Context Injection)**

Skill authors write standard relative paths (e.g., `./scripts/...` or `scripts/...`) in their `SKILL.md`. At runtime, the system injects the skill content with:

1. A **Skill Catalog** listing all available skills
2. **Critical Rules** for path resolution (applies to ALL skills)
3. **Skill Details** with each preloaded skill's Root Path and content

_Injection Format Example:_

```markdown
## Agent Skills

### Skill Catalog

- **java_expert**: Java development expert with access to formatters and templates.

To load a skill not shown in detail below, use the `load_skill` tool.

### Critical Rules for Using Skills

> **Path Resolution Required for Skill Files**
>
> Skill instructions use relative paths (e.g., `./scripts/run.sh` or `scripts/run.sh`) to refer to internal files.
> However, standard tools resolve relative paths against the User's Workspace, not the skill directory.
>
> When using ANY file from a skill, you MUST convert its path to ABSOLUTE:
> `Root Path` + `Relative Path` = `Absolute Path`
>
> **Examples:**
>
> 1. Root Path: `/path/to/skill`
>    Relative: `./scripts/run.sh`
>    Result: `/path/to/skill/scripts/run.sh`
>
> 2. Root Path: `/path/to/skill`
>    Relative: `scripts/run.sh`
>    Result: `/path/to/skill/scripts/run.sh`

### Skill Details

#### java_expert

**Root Path:** `/home/user/skills/java_expert`

[content of SKILL.md here]
```

## 2. Core Components

### A. `Skill` Model

A data class representing a loaded skill.

- `name` (string): Unique identifier.
- `description` (string): Short summary.
- `root_path` (string): Absolute path to the skill directory (Critical for accessing assets).
- `entry_point_content` (string): The content of `SKILL.md` (loaded on demand).

### B. `SkillRegistry`

A central registry responsible for:

1.  **Discovery**: Scanning configured paths (e.g., `src/skills/`) for `SKILL.md` files.
2.  **Resolution**: Identifying the `SKILL.md` and the `root_path`.
3.  **Retrieval**: Providing access to the skill object.

### C. `LoadSkillTool`

A standard Agent Tool enabling autonomy.

- **Name**: `load_skill`
- **Arguments**: `skill_name` (string)
- **Behavior**:
  1.  Validates the skill exists in `SkillRegistry`.
  2.  Returns a formatted string containing the `SKILL.md` content and the `root_path`.

## 3. Configuration & Integration

We support flexible skill definition via `AgentConfig`.

### A. Preloaded Skills (Static / Vertical Agents)

For specialized agents, skills are defined in the configuration. The system supports **Hybrid Loading** (Names & Paths).

- **Config**:
  ```ts
  const config = new AgentConfig({
    skills: [
      'java_expert',             // Registered Name
      '/home/user/dev/new_skill' // Ad-hoc Local Path
    ]
  });
  ```
- **Startup Logic**:
  1.  **Paths**: If an entry is a path, the `SkillRegistry` dynamically loads and registers it (using the name defined in its `SKILL.md`).
  2.  **Names**: It looks up existing registered skills.
- **Result**: The `SKILL.md` content for _all_ listed skills is injected into the System Prompt.

### B. Dynamic Skills (Generalist Agents)

For flexible agents, skills are discovered on demand.

- **Config**: `AgentConfig(..., skills=[])` (but `SkillRegistry` has many available)
- **Behavior**: Only metadata (Name/Description) is in the System Prompt.
- **Trigger**:
  - The Agent, upon reading the user's natural language request (e.g., "Use the java skill"), decides to call the **`load_skill`** tool to retrieve the map.
  - No "magic shortcuts" (like `$skill`) are required; it follows standard tool usage patterns.

## 4. Execution Flow: The Universal "Deep Dive"

Regardless of _how_ the skill map (`SKILL.md`) was loaded (Preloaded vs. Dynamic), the "Deep Dive" phase is identical.

1.  **Possession of the Map**: The Agent has the `SKILL.md` content (either in System Prompt or recent context).
2.  **Reading the Map**: The Agent reads: _"For template X, see ./templates/X.java"_.
3.  **The "Deep Dive" Action**:
    - The Agent constructs the absolute path by combining the skill's `root_path` with the relative path (e.g., `/home/user/skills/java_expert` + `./templates/X.java` = `/home/user/skills/java_expert/templates/X.java`).
    - The Agent then calls the `read_file` tool, passing this absolute path as the `path` parameter.

### Example: Preloaded "Java Agent" (Static)

1.  **Startup**: `AgentConfig` has `skills=["java_expert"]`. System Prompt includes `SKILL.md` for `java_expert`.
2.  **User**: "Create a Spring Boot app."
3.  **Reasoning**: Agent immediately knows where the template is (from System Prompt).
4.  **Action**: Constructs the absolute path and calls `read_file` with that path.

### Example: Dynamic "General Assistant" (On-Demand)

1.  **Startup**: No preloaded skills. System Prompt just lists "Available: java_expert".
2.  **User**: "I need to fix a Java bug, please use the java skill."
3.  **Reasoning**: "The user requested the java skill. I should load it."
4.  **Action 1**: Calls `load_skill` with the skill name `java_expert`.
5.  **Observation**: Receives `SKILL.md` content and root path.
6.  **Reasoning**: "The map says debugging docs are at ./docs/memory.md. I need to construct the absolute path."
7.  **Action 2**: Constructs the absolute path (root path + `./docs/memory.md`) and calls `read_file` with that path.

## 5. Benefits

1.  **Infinite Extensibility**: A skill can contain entire libraries, specialized CLI tools, or encyclopedias of text, without bloating the prompt.
2.  **Polyglot Support**: A skill folder can contain Python scripts, Java JARs, Bash scripts, etc. To execute a script, the agent constructs the absolute path and calls the appropriate tool (e.g., `run_bash` for shell scripts, or uses Node.js/ts-node for `.js`/`.ts` files if installed).
3.  **Context Efficiency**: The Agent only loads the "Index" (`SKILL.md`). It only pays the context cost for "Deep Dive" items if the specific task requires them.
