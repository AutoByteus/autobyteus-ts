# Node.js Architecture & Migration Notes

This document captures the Node.js/TypeScript architecture patterns, conventions, and migration-specific decisions for the `autobyteus-ts` codebase. It is intended to be read alongside `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `migrate_nodesjs_ticket/MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md`, and `migrate_nodesjs_ticket/MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md`.

## 1. Purpose

- Preserve the common Node.js patterns adopted during migration.
- Provide a single reference for registration conventions, testing structure, and runtime design decisions.
- Keep context small for future contributors or agents after context compaction.

## 2. Composition Roots & Registration

Python uses metaclasses to auto-register tools and processors at import time. In Node.js/TypeScript we keep the same "it just works" experience, but we make registration deterministic by funneling it through a single bootstrap entrypoint.

### Tools
- Pattern: `registerTools()` (in `src/tools/register-tools.ts`) is called once at startup.
- What it does:
  - Registers functional tools via their `registerXTool()` helpers (which also return a cached instance).
  - Registers class-based tools via `registerToolClass(...)`.
- Where it is called: `AgentFactory` constructor (framework-owned, not user-facing).
- Rationale: avoid user manual steps, keep parity with Python auto-registration, and prevent import-order issues by centralizing registration.

### Processors
- System prompt processors: `registerSystemPromptProcessors()`.
- Input processors: explicit registration if used (metaclass removed).
- Tool invocation preprocessors, tool result processors, LLM response processors, lifecycle processors: follow the same explicit registration pattern.

## 3. Testing Structure

- Unit tests live in `autobyteus-ts/tests/unit/...`.
- Integration tests live in `autobyteus-ts/tests/integration/...`.
- Runner: `pnpm exec vitest --run <test-paths>`.
- Environment: `.env.test` contains API keys and runtime settings for integration tests.
- Policy: tests are migrated from Python to preserve behavior and coverage; avoid dummy tests.
- If integration tests are blocked by unmigrated dependencies or external services, mark them as **Deferred** in `MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md` with a reason.

## 4. Agent Runtime Concurrency (Node.js Design)

Python runs each agent in its own thread and private asyncio event loop. In Node.js we preserve the same isolation and ordering guarantees using an **actor-style mailbox** per agent.

### 4.1 Core Pattern: Actor + Mailbox

- Each agent owns a **single serialized async loop** and a **mailbox (queue)**.
- All agent state mutations happen inside that loop (no shared concurrent mutation).
- External callers submit events by enqueuing into the mailbox (no cross-thread scheduling needed in-process).
- This mirrors Python’s “one thread per agent” semantics without OS threads.

### 4.2 Queue Semantics (Parity with Python)

- Maintain **multiple input queues** (user, inter-agent, tool invocation, tool result, tool approval, internal system).
- Preserve **deterministic priority ordering** (same priority list as Python).
- Implement the two-phase selection (buffered items first; otherwise wait on all queues, buffer completed, cancel pending) to avoid reordering.

### 4.3 Lifecycle Phases

- **Runtime init**: initialize event store, status deriver, input queues.
- **Bootstrap**: run bootstrap steps inside the agent loop (workspace, MCP prewarm, system prompt processing).
- **Main loop**: await next input event, dispatch to handlers, yield to loop.
- **Shutdown**: run shutdown orchestrator inside the agent loop after exit.

### 4.4 When to Use worker_threads

- Use **worker_threads** only for CPU-heavy workloads or hard isolation needs.
- Default remains single-process async loops with mailbox isolation.
- Optional hybrid: shared worker pool for CPU tasks, agents remain in main loop.

### 4.5 Design Goals

- Preserve per-agent isolation and ordering.
- Keep deterministic status transitions and event handling.
- Avoid implicit global state mutation.
  

## 5. Source of Truth for Migration State

- Strategy: `migrate_nodesjs_ticket/MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md`
- Progress tracking: `migrate_nodesjs_ticket/MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md`
- Architecture map: `ARCHITECTURE.md` (with Node.js additions)

## 6. CLI / TUI (Ink)

The Node.js CLI uses **Ink** for the interactive TUI and a lightweight console renderer for single-agent sessions.

- **Single-agent CLI** (`src/cli/agent`):
  - `cli_display.ts`: stateful renderer for stream events (segment tags, thinking blocks, approvals).
  - `agent_cli.ts`: controller loop (input, approvals, lifecycle) using `AgentEventStream`.
- **Agent team TUI** (`src/cli/agent-team`):
  - `state_store.ts`: reducer-style state store (team/agent/task status, approvals, history).
  - `app.tsx`: Ink composition root (sidebar + focus pane + status bar).
  - `widgets/*`: pure components (sidebar, focus pane, task plan panel, status bar, logo).

This mirrors the Python Textual/TUI architecture while keeping renderer logic testable and UI components reactive.
