- 2026-02-05: Created ticket, strategy doc, runtime simulation, and implementation plan. Tests not run.
- 2026-02-05: Renamed Active Transcript to Working Context Snapshot across source, tests, and docs. Added working context snapshot serializer, store, bootstrapper, restore bootstrap step, and persistence wiring in `MemoryManager`. Added restore support in `AgentFactory` and runtime state restore options. Updated bootstrapper to include restore step, added new unit/integration tests, and updated integration test list. Exported `resolveMemoryBaseDir` in `src/memory/index.js`.
